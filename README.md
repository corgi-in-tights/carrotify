# Carrotify

`Updated 1 June 2023`


my first Minecraft mod! intended to be a test and swerve into Java more than anything else. you can tell it's my first mod because I included the `build/` and `run/` dirs lol

adds carrot-y things into the game :) still really proud of that unstable carrot btw, that was pretty hard for me back then
